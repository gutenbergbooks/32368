<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>In calling your attention to a deceptive entertainment,
Legerdemain, more generally known as Conjuring,
a few introductory remarks may not be out of
place. The superstition that existed in the early ages,
when wizards and magicians were supposed to exist,
time has not worn out; the mystery that hangs over
all professors of magic is still in part retained. Many
there are who class them amongst supernatural
beings, their seeming impossibilities are converted
into positive realities, their power supposed to be
supreme. Now, were I, in this the twentieth century,
to stand before you professing to be a wizard or a
magician&mdash;or, in fact, to be that which I am not&mdash;endowed
with supernatural power, it would be
looked upon as a gross insult to your good sense; for
in truth the only peculiarity of my profession is to
deceive&mdash;yours to detect. If my hands are quicker
than your eyes, I shall have the pleasure of deceiving
you; but, on the contrary, if your eyes are quicker
than my hands, the reverse will be the result.</p>

<h2><big>Peerless Prestidigitation.</big></h2>

<h2>THE LATEST CARD FORCE.</h2>


<p><i>Effect.</i>&mdash;A pack of unprepared cards is shuffled
by any member of the audience and handed to the
performer, who requests one of the spectators to
secretly note a card by simply raising a portion of
the pack whilst held in the hand of the performer,
who turns his head away whilst this is being done.
The cards are again shuffled, and the performer
instantly names the selected card.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image003.png" width="600" height="357" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;After the cards have been
thoroughly examined and shuffled by the spectators
the performer takes the pack (face downwards) and
quietly bends them over his hand, the bend being so
slight that it is hardly noticeable. He then grasps
the pack at one end between the first finger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
thumb of either hand, and requests a spectator to
select a card in the manner described above. It will
be found that the action of raising the cards causes a
slight break at the spectator's card, and enables the
performer to insert his little finger beneath the same
and make the pass which brings the selected card to
the bottom. After getting a glimpse of the card the
pack can be again shuffled and the trick brought to a
conclusion in any manner desired.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_PHANTOM_CARD" id="THE_PHANTOM_CARD"></a>THE PHANTOM CARD.</h2>


<p><i>Effect.</i>&mdash;A pack of cards is spread face downwards
upon the table, and one of the audience is requested
to choose five cards and hand the same to the performer,
who arranges the cards fan-shape in his
hand. The spectator is now asked to name any one
of the five cards, after which the performer drops the
cards face <i>upwards</i> upon the table, and, to the astonishment
of the audience, the named card has entirely
vanished, four cards only being visible. These cards
are now turned face downwards and mixed with the
remainder of the pack, which it will be remembered is
still lying scattered upon the table. The performer,
showing his hands quite empty, now proceeds to select
another five cards, which he places face down upon
the floor at the feet of his temporary assistant and
asks him to touch with a stick any one of the five
cards. The assistant does so, and, to his astonishment,
the touched card is turned over and seen to be
the missing card.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;When the pack has been spread
face down upon the table and the five cards handed
to the performer, he asks for one of the five cards to
be named. This having been done, he gives the cards
a shuffle, and contrives to get the named card to the
top, and secretly reverses it. It will thus be seen that
when the cards are dropped faces up upon the other
cards scattered about the table, the selected card has
apparently vanished. The four remaining cards are
now turned over and mixed with the others, the performer
being careful not to lose sight of the named
card. Five cards are now taken seemingly at random
off the table, one of them of course being the selected
card. The faces of these five cards are not shown,
but are immediately placed upon the floor, care being
taken to get THE card in the centre of the row. It
will be found that in nine cases out of ten the
spectator invariably touches the middle card, which,
on being turned over, is found to be the one he
originally selected. Should the spectator, however,
touch any other card you simply revert to the well-known
(to conjurers) dodge of "Very well, we don't
require this card," etc., etc.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>
THE "DE CASTON" METHOD OF<br />
"RISING CARDS" FROM HAND.
</h2>


<p><i>Effect.</i>&mdash;Several cards having been selected and
marked by the audience are returned to the pack,
which is thoroughly shuffled. The cards rise from the
pack whilst held in the performer's hand, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
two-thirds of the card is visible. The performer requests
the spectator to remove his card himself, which he
does, the card being drawn out from about the centre
of the pack. The remaining cards are produced in a
like manner, the effect being quite weird.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image004.png" width="600" height="507" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of this most
mystifying card effect it is necessary to prepare a
few cards by cutting an oblong slit in each card wide
enough to admit the first finger. These cards are then
placed in a side pocket, or <i>pochette</i>, and the remainder
of the pack handed to several spectators for the
purpose of having cards selected and marked. This
having been done the performer proceeds to collect the
cards, each card when placed in the pack being brought
to the top by means of the pass, and after the last
card has been returned, the conjurer palms off all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the selected cards and hands the pack out to be
shuffled. On again receiving the pack in his hands
he immediately replaces the palmed cards on top of
the pack, and whilst calling attention to what has
been done as regards freedom of choice, marking,
shuffling, etc., he secretly secures the prepared cards
and places them upon the chosen ones. By keeping a
couple of fingers across the back of the pack it is an
easy matter to casually show the front and back of the
cards, and a great deal should be made of the fact
that no threads, etc., are employed. When the first
card (<i>i.e.</i>, the last one returned by the audience) is
well out of the pack, the finger again covers the slit
and the pack is presented to the chooser for him to
remove his card and verify the mark. The other
cards are similarly dealt with, and the prepared ones
are finally palmed off, disposed of, and the pack again
passed for inspection.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="DE_CASTONS_DISCOVERY" id="DE_CASTONS_DISCOVERY"></a>DE CASTON'S DISCOVERY.</h2>

<p class="center"><b>AN ENTIRELY NEW CARD EFFECT.</b></p>


<p>A pack of cards having been shuffled, the performer
deals about fifteen cards one by one face
upwards upon the table, remarking, "You will observe
that the cards are thoroughly mixed." During this
action (which is the whole secret of this experiment)
the performer secretly notes the <i>fifth</i> card from the
top of the pack, and when gathering up the cards takes
care that the noted card is left in its original position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
He now makes four heaps of cards (faces down and
about eight or ten cards in each heap), taking the
cards from the <i>bottom</i> of the pack, and when this has
been done the conjurer quickly deals from the top of
the pack one card on to the top of each heap,
immediately throwing the next card (<i>i.e.</i>, the noted
one) face downwards to one of the spectators, who is
requested to remember the card (which has seemingly
been thrown out at random), and while he is doing so
the performer is busy dealing the remainder of the
cards in his hands on to the top of the four heaps.
The spectator is now requested to place his card in
any heap he prefers, and put all the heaps together,
and again thoroughly shuffle, during which time the
performer turns his back so as not to see which heap
the card is placed in. It is now an easy matter to tell
the name of the card, which should be done with
hesitation and plenty of dramatic gesture. Try this
trick, and remember to work it at rather a high rate
of speed, and watch the effect on your audience.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="A_SPECTACULAR_HANDKERCHIEF" id="A_SPECTACULAR_HANDKERCHIEF"></a>A SPECTACULAR HANDKERCHIEF
COMBINATION.</h2>


<p><i>Effect.</i>&mdash;Three white handkerchiefs are borrowed, a
coloured one being added to them (this being performer's
own), and placed in a box; an umbrella is
shown, replaced in its case, and a change is commanded
to take place. The box is opened, and in place of the
four handkerchiefs is the umbrella cover, and upon
opening the umbrella case the umbrella is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
minus the cover and the four handkerchiefs attached
to its ribs. The handkerchiefs are removed and laid
on a table, the umbrella being returned to the case,
which is then placed aside.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 551px;">
<img src="images/image005.png" width="551" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>One of the white handkerchiefs and a pair of sharp
scissors are taken to a spectator who is asked to mark
the same, which he does, the result being (to the
consternation of the performer) a large piece cut out
of the centre. The performer apologises for the
accident, and mentions that by a similar misunderstanding
one of his own handkerchiefs was similarly
treated the previous evening, in proof of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
shows a coloured handkerchief with a piece cut out of
the centre. He says he will endeavour to restore the
white handkerchief, and at the same time he will
restore the coloured one. He places the two handkerchiefs
with their respective loose centres in another
piece of apparatus, and upon removing them discovers
to his horror that the white handkerchief has the
coloured centre and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. He makes a frantic
endeavour to unpick the stitches, finally giving it up
in despair. Another piece of apparatus is now introduced
into which he places the two handkerchiefs, and
thinking that it would be more interesting if he used
all the borrowed handkerchiefs, he picks up the
remaining handkerchiefs from the table and places
them along with the two unfortunates. The performer
announces that he is about to cut them all up, but
before commencing to do so bethinks himself of his
own good handkerchief which he removes and places
in his pocket. After some by-play the handkerchiefs
are shown in dozens of strips, which are offered to the
respective owners to sort out, but this not meeting
with the approbation of the lenders, the performer
introduces a dove-pan into which he places the torn
strips, and whilst descanting upon his trials and troubles
he holds a lighted candle near the dove-pan and the
pieces of cambric catch light. In order to extinguish
the fire the performer claps the lid on the pan, and on
removing the cover, out fly two doves, and the
conjurer immediately removes the three borrowed
handkerchiefs and his own coloured one quite
restored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;This combination will enable
magicians to bring into play some apparatus which
they have probably put aside as obviously too
mechanical. Properly presented, no better effect can
be wished for.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/image006.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>I shall not take up space by describing in detail
the various pieces of apparatus, the working, I take it,
being well known to magicians of the present day.</p>

<p><i>You will require</i>:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li><span class="smcap">A Changing Drawer Box</span>, with umbrella cover
in one compartment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></li>

<li><span class="smcap">One Intelligent Assistant</span>, if procurable.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>To perform</i>:&mdash;The conjurer requests the loan of
several white handkerchiefs. A number being offered,
he accepts three, which he throws over a chair back
while he calls attention to the empty condition of the
drawer box. The performer now takes the borrowed
handkerchiefs one by one and places them in the box.
After placing the third handkerchief in the drawer
box, he looks round as if for another handkerchief,
and remarks, "I should have borrowed <i>four</i> handkerchiefs,
but I will not trouble you again, I will use my
own." Drawing this (the coloured one) from his pocket
and placing it in the box with the three white ones,
he closes the drawer. The drawer box is now placed
on a table or chair near the footlights. The performer
next introduces the umbrella tube, being careful to
remove the lid from the end containing the unprepared
parasol, which he withdraws, opens, and passes for
inspection to prove its unpreparedness. The parasol
being returned is placed back into the tube, the lid
put on, and in turning to place the tube on the table,
it (the tube) is reversed, which brings the lid covering
the division containing the skeleton umbrella towards
audience when laid on the table. The performer now
commands a change to take place, and picking up the
box he pulls out the drawer containing the parasol
cover, which he removes and shows to audience. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
opening the umbrella tube, he withdraws the skeleton
parasol with the four duplicate handkerchiefs attached
to the ribs; the four handkerchiefs are unfastened and
laid on the table, the audience believing them to be those
originally borrowed. The performer now selects one
of the white handkerchiefs, takes up the pair of
scissors and asks one of the spectators to mark the
handkerchief so that he will know it again&mdash;the conjurer
holding the handkerchief in such a manner that
the spectator is compelled to cut a circular piece out
of the centre. While the gentleman is cutting the
handkerchief, the assistant enters and removes the
drawer box and umbrella tube, as having been finished
with, and when behind the scenes he opens the box
and removes the three borrowed handkerchiefs and
the performer's coloured one, all of which he folds
neatly and places in the inner lining of the dove-pan,
finally putting in the two doves and locking lid to
lining by the usual bayonet catch. During this time
the performer has been apologising for the damage
done to the white handkerchief, and the owner not
caring to accept his property in its present condition,
the performer calls attention to the burning globe, and
states that by placing the mutilated handkerchief in
the globe he can immediately restore it; at the same
time he mentions that "the previous evening I had
the misfortune to have my own handkerchief marked
in a similar manner" (picks up coloured handkerchief
and loose centre from table and shows to audience),
"and will take the opportunity of restoring my own
coloured handkerchief whilst I am restoring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
borrowed white one." After showing the globe to be
empty, the performer places the two damaged handkerchiefs,
with their respective loose centres, into
same and gives the body of globe a quarter-turn, which
brings the compartment containing the white handkerchief
with coloured centre, and the coloured handkerchief
with white centre uppermost. After allowing
the "spirits" due time to repair the damaged <span class="smcap">mouchoirs</span>
the performer requests one of the spectators to remove
the handkerchiefs, and on his doing so, it is found that
the centres have been sewn into the wrong handkerchiefs.
The conjurer now makes an attempt to undo
the stitches, but finds it impossible, so states that "I
shall have to cut the handkerchiefs up in order to
restore them to their original condition." During this
little bit of by-play, the assistant enters, bringing with
him, unostentatiously, the lid of the dove-pan, which
he places on the centre table, retiring immediately
with the brass globe, now finished with. The performer
now introduces the handkerchief mill and
removes the knives in order to show their sharpness,
and the two handkerchiefs are placed in the empty
compartment (the other division, it will be remembered,
contains the strips of handkerchiefs); but on second
thoughts the performer considers that it is unfair not
to treat all the handkerchiefs alike, so he picks up the
remaining two white handkerchiefs and the coloured
one from the table and places them also in the
mill.</p>

<p>Before commencing to cut the handkerchiefs up,
the performer removes his own coloured one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
places it in his pocket, remarking that "to damage my
own handkerchief would be ridiculous." The performer
now makes the knives revolve, and shortly
afterwards pulls the strips of handkerchiefs out of the
second compartment and drops them into the dove-pan,
saying, "The damage to the handkerchiefs is irreparable,
but I will endeavour to iron the pieces and
the lenders can sort them out at their leisure. I believe
it is necessary when doing any ironing to sprinkle a
little water over the objects to be ironed" (sprinkle strips
with spirits of wine from bottle) "and also to wax the
iron, but as I have no wax and no iron, I will light
the candle and drop a little of the melted wax on the
pieces of handkerchiefs." Whilst lighting the candle
the conjurer carelessly drops the lighted match in the
dove-pan, the spirits of wine become ignited and there
is a great blaze. The performer gets excited and
endeavours to blow out the flames, and not being
successful, he frantically grasps the lid of the pan and
claps it on to same, immediately afterwards picking up
his revolver and firing over the pan, finally removing
the lid (which leaves the inner lining inside pan) and
allowing the doves to escape.</p>

<p>The handkerchiefs are now removed and handed
back to their respective owners, the performer's
coloured handkerchief being returned to his pocket.</p>

<p>If the above description has been carefully followed
it will be seen that although an enormous amount of
destruction has apparently been going on, in reality
only one white handkerchief is destroyed at each
performance of the experiment.</p>

to go twice round the casket, candle in candlestick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
box of matches and a folding brass music stand
carrying a frame in which is suspended the casket.
The casket has the front lid and two sides of glass,
the back and bottom being of wood. A wooden flap
is hinged to lower portion of back, and a small silk
flag is roughly rolled up and placed behind the flap,
which is held up by a small catch operating from back
of casket. Casket can now be shown empty amongst
the audience without fear of flag or flap being seen.
The hollow egg is vested, and the second flag rolled
up and placed in matchbox ready for production
from flame of candle. The ordinary egg can either be
brought on openly or magically produced. I prefer
using one of the eggs I have previously produced in
the "four eggs at finger tips" trick.</p>

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;Show the egg and wrap same in
the double handkerchief, taking care that the egg is
placed in the slit; twist the handkerchief round so as
to show shape of the egg, and call attention to the fact
that the egg can be seen throughout the performance,
and lay same over chair back, egg towards audience.
Show casket empty and hand the tape to spectator, asking
him to tie same round the casket, the performer
holding casket whilst it is being tied. It is now suspended
in the frame on stand (two small brass chains
with hooks at end being used for this purpose), and
covered with borrowed handkerchief. In the act of
covering the casket, performer releases the flap which
drops down inside the casket, thus releasing the duplicate
flag previously placed therein. The candle is now
lighted and the flag produced from flame. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
calling attention once more to the egg in the handkerchief
and to the empty (?) casket, the performer
secures the hollow egg from vest and proceeds to
vanish the flag by working it into the opening at the
side of egg. When the flag is well tucked in, the conjurer,
without showing egg, explains what he is about to do&mdash;to
cause the egg to leave the handkerchief and appear
in his hand, and the flag to pass from his hand into
the empty casket. <i>Presto!</i> the hands are opened, the
egg is shown, and placed in a conspicuous position on
the table; the casket is uncovered and handed to
spectator to untie the tapes and remove the flag.</p>

<p>The performer now commences to introduce his
<i>next</i> trick, seemingly forgetting about the handkerchief
which is still hanging over chair back, and of course
the usual "smart" gentleman asks, "What about the
egg in the handkerchief?" Performer seems flurried,
but otherwise takes no notice of the remark, and pretends
to be anxious to get on with his next item.
The audience insists that the egg is still in the handkerchief,
and performer then calls attention to the egg
on the table, which he asserts is the one he wrapped
up in the handkerchief, and "eggstracted" by magic.
The audience do not believe it, so the magician, with
seeming reluctance, very gingerly picks up the handkerchief
from the chair and shakes same out (the
handkerchief, not the chair), and the egg is "found"
to have disappeared, proving (?) that the egg seen on
table is the identical one which was wrapped up at
commencement of trick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>I am indebted to my esteemed brother magicians,
Messrs. <span class="smcap">T. Hayes</span>, <span class="smcap">W. G. Malvern</span>, and <span class="smcap">J. Hempstead</span>,
for the description of the following original and
novel experiments:&mdash;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="A_NEW_HANDKERCHIEF_COMBINATION" id="A_NEW_HANDKERCHIEF_COMBINATION"></a>A NEW HANDKERCHIEF COMBINATION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>By W. G. Malvern, Coin and Card Manipulator</b></span>.</p>


<p>The requirements for this excellent trick are as
follows:&mdash;A glass gas chimney, four silk handkerchiefs&mdash;one
red, one blue, and two white. A small
<i>f&ecirc;ke</i>&mdash;consisting of a brass tube about two inches long
and just large enough to slip over the forefinger of the
right hand. There must be soldered at the top of
the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> on the outside, a piece of wire forming a small
hook. The <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> should, for obvious reasons, be
covered with flesh-coloured silk.</p>

<p>A sheet of cartridge paper rolled up to form a tube
and of such a size as to fit over the glass cylinder is
also required.</p>

<p>The presentation of the trick is as follows:&mdash;The
performer commences by showing an ordinary glass
cylinder to be unprepared and free from deception.
The three handkerchiefs are next shown, and in
placing them on the table the blue handkerchief is
casually dropped over the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> which is lying there
loaded with a duplicate white handkerchief. The red
handkerchief is then picked up along with the cylinder
and placed in one end; then the blue handkerchief
(and with it the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i>) is inserted in the other end of
the cylinder. The hook on the f&ecirc;ke engages the rim of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the cylinder, which prevents it from slipping down. The
performer now covers the cylinder with the tube of
paper, and in doing so the forefinger is pushed through
the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i>, which action causes the concealed handkerchief
to appear between the blue and red handkerchiefs,
and when withdrawing the finger, the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> is brought
away on it, which, of course, cannot be seen owing to
the flesh-coloured silk.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;">
<img src="images/image008.jpg" width="511" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>The trick is now practically finished; all the
performer has to do is to vanish the white handkerchief
into the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i>, which is removed from the finger,
and command the white handkerchief to appear
between the red and blue handkerchiefs in the cylinder.
On removing the paper tube this is seen to have been
done.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PHANTOM_COIN_TRICK" id="THE_PHANTOM_COIN_TRICK"></a>THE "PHANTOM" COIN TRICK.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>By J. Hempstead, Magician.</b></span></p>


<p>The coin trick I am about to describe is most
suitable for performing in a room, and has the advantage
of being easily mastered by anybody after five
minutes' practice. This sleight has perplexed many
of the world's leading magicians, amongst whom may
be mentioned Mr. Horace Goldin.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image009.jpg" width="600" height="585" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>The effect of the trick is as follows:&mdash;The performer
rolls up his right sleeve to the elbow, and then sits
down at a table. One of the spectators is requested
to sit down opposite him, and having obtained the
loan of a sixpence, he places the coin in his palm
in full view of everybody. The performer then closes
his hand on the table, knuckles upwards, and asks the
spectator sitting opposite him to place his hand on his
(performer's), which he does, and then the performer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
saying "One! two! three! Pass!!" asks the spectator
if he felt the coin leave the hand and pass through
<i>his</i> (spectator's), to which, of course, the answer is
"No"; but, nevertheless, on the spectator removing
his hand, and the performer opening his, the coin is
found to have completely vanished. The hands are
shown absolutely empty, fingers wide apart, no
palming being employed.</p>

<p>The effect of this little trick cannot be sufficiently
judged by a description in print, but must be put into
actual practice to be thoroughly appreciated.</p>

<p><i>To perform.</i>&mdash;When the performer (with right arm
bared to elbow) asks the spectator to place his hand on
his (performer's), he brings his left elbow on to the
table and rests his head on his left hand&mdash;quite a
natural position&mdash;and when the spectator puts his hand
on the performer's (which in nine cases out of ten will be
in the form of a fist like performer's), the conjurer
exclaims, "No, no! not that way; put your hand
<i>flat</i> on mine," on saying which the spectator will
naturally remove his hand for an instant&mdash;and now
comes the conjuring part of the experiment. As the
spectator removes his hand performer raises his fist
with a quick up-and-down motion, and as his hand
descends the coin is thrown through the bottom of fist
into left sleeve. This motion must be done very
smartly and at the right moment, but with a little
practice will be found quite easy of accomplishment.</p>

<p>It will now be clear that when the spectator again
puts his hand on top of the performer's, the trick is
done, and it does not take much of a magician to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
cause the disappearance of the coin. Of course,
should the spectator at first place his hand <i>flat</i> on your
fist, the same formula is gone through as before, only
<i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="AN_ORIGINAL_EGGSTRA_SPECIAL_COMBINATION" id="AN_ORIGINAL_EGGSTRA_SPECIAL_COMBINATION"></a>AN ORIGINAL "EGGSTRA" SPECIAL COMBINATION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>By T. Hayes, Conjurer and Illusionist.</b></span></p>


<p><i>Effect.</i>&mdash;Appear with wand in hand, and after usual
introductory patter lay wand on table and pick up a
piece of white tissue paper&mdash;size, say, 6 by 4 inches.
Roll this up into a ball and place on the palm of the
left hand; then, shaking it to and fro, it gradually
assumes the form of an egg. Lay this on the table while
you light a candle (ready in candlestick); pick up the
egg again and hold it over the candle to harden it. In
a minute show the egg and have the same examined.
Make a few passes&mdash;limited only by the skill of the
performer&mdash;eventually placing it in the left hand (back
to audience) and command it to pass; show empty
hand, at the same time point to candle on table, when
the audience see the egg balanced on top of same.
Take it off and bring forward with candle and show.
Replace the candle and pick up a handkerchief. Cover
egg with handkerchief and taking hold of egg through
same, gather up the four loose ends and give to someone
to hold. Take up your pistol and fire at same, and
laying down pistol, pick up plate and ask assistant
to place the handkerchief on it; then open out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
handkerchief, and in centre in place of the egg he finds
original piece of paper (initialed previously if desired).</p>

<p>Now take piece of paper, and laying down plate and
handkerchief, make a fist of left hand and push paper
in at top, draw it out at bottom of hand, when it is
seen to have changed to a white silk handkerchief.
Show this both sides, holding it at two top corners;
then roll it up rope fashion, and pulling hands apart,
a handkerchief is seen in both hands&mdash;one white and
one yellow (here you may remark "The white and yolk;
simply a question of colour"). Now roll these two
together in the hands, and hold in right hand over candle,
saying, "I will hard-boil it," and show the egg again.
Pass for examination, asking if it is a good one; on reply
of "Yes," say "Well, I have my doubts, but we will
test it." Throw it in the air two or three times and
the egg disappears, you remarking, "I was afraid
there might be a chicken in it."</p>

<p><i>Explanation.</i>&mdash;When you pick up piece of paper at
first, you take up with it a "skin" egg, neatly folded,
with a thin strip of paper round it to prevent it
prematurely expanding. It is this that is placed in
palm of left hand, and paper strip torn loose. Lay
gently on table and light candle, and as you lay down
matchbox with right hand (right side to audience),
palm egg in left hand from hip pocket or vest. Pick
up "skin" egg and hold over candle, presently remarking
"It's getting hot"; suddenly place it apparently in
the left hand (really crushing it up and finger palming),
and show palmed egg in left hand. After sundry
"passes" "vanish" to candle. This is worked on same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
principle as "Card in Candle," or "Card on Ale
Bottle," using a half shell (cut lengthwise). When you
go to take egg, remove with left hand and place in
right, in which is original egg still palmed. The shell
fits on this, so only one egg appears. Pick up the candlestick
in left hand, and bring it forward to show it quite
unprepared, allowing the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> to fall forward flat on table.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/image010.jpg" width="337" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>Replace the candle and pick up the handkerchief.
This has an oval wire shape in centre covered by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
piece of the same material as the handkerchief&mdash;this
fits over egg, which presses out handkerchief into
proper shape. When you pretend to take hold of the
egg through handkerchief, you really seize this&mdash;allowing
egg to drop into right palm out of sight.
Gather up the four ends of the handkerchief with
this hand, which adds cover for egg. Let go top
(egg?) with left hand and ask assistant to hold handkerchief
for you. In handing it to him first take it in
your left hand and let your right fall naturally to side,
and either "vest" or "<i>profonde</i>" egg. Now take up
pistol and fire at egg (?) in handkerchief, and picking
up the plate or tray, lay down pistol and ask assistant
to lay handkerchief with the egg gently on it. With
your other hand open out handkerchief&mdash;when he sees
roll of paper on same. (This is original piece, palmed
in when pretending to place egg in. The wire frame
holds it in position.) Let your assistant open out the
paper and verify mark (if one was made). Meanwhile,
lay down the plate and handkerchief on the table, at
the same time palming small <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> containing white silk
handkerchief in left hand. Now take back piece of
paper from assistant and thank him; then make left
hand into a fist and push the paper in at top till all is in.
This pushes out handkerchief from the <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> into the
palm; then secretly remove <i>f&ecirc;ke</i> on finger, continuing
the pushing with another finger (old idea). Now draw
out silk handkerchief from bottom of left hand&mdash;show
it by holding it at the top corners, in front of you&mdash;gradually
raise right hand and lower left; as you do
so, seize the corner of the yellow handkerchief which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
protrudes through one of waistcoat buttonholes. (I
have a small black bead sewn to the corner to make
this easy.) As soon as yellow handkerchief is clear,
the left hand should have reached buttonhole and
now seizes last corner; then a quick turn (ropewise)
rolls up the yellow in the white. Pull hands apart
gently, retaining end of yellow handkerchief in one
hand and the end of white in the other, and let
the audience see both, one in each hand. Now roll
these up in the hands, "balling" them well, and hold
over candle (or a Stodare egg can be used, making
all safe). After a minute, show egg, saying, "It's
getting hot!"&mdash;change from hand to hand, thus
changing for real original egg, which you had just
before palmed from vest or pocket, and hand for
examination. The final vanish is, of course, into
the <i>profonde</i> and needs no explanation.</p>
